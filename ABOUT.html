                    I know you’re so happy for me right now and about to say that big congratulation. Let me tell you how it happened.

                    After reviewing my portfolio on Upwork and LinkedIn, the firm immediately trusted my ability and confirmed my credibility.
                    However, I had to answer a few questions before being handed the contract.

                    So, I was asked, “Why hire Olaniyi?”
                    Without hesitation, I answered,
                
                  </p>

                  <p class="dark">   My watchword is SQ — Speed and Quality. Thus, I have a reputation for delivering top-notch content on time without compromising quality.

                    Talk is cheap, and anyone can claim to be what they’re not; hence, I believe in evidence. Besides my LinkedIn profile, I suggest you designate two minutes to check my Upwork profile to see my work history, reviews, and testimonials. Here’s the link https://lnkd.in/gj-3mBPf.

                    55 reviews and 5 testimonials cannot lie, after all, ??.

                    If you’re satisfied with what you see, don’t hesitate to revert. I’ll be expecting your feedback in my dm.

                    These replies landed me the million-dollar contract until my Mum called and I woke from my slumber. It was at that juncture I realized I was only daydreaming. There was no million-dollar contract yet ??.

                    My dear CEOs, hiring managers, and recruiters, those replies are for you; you may go back to reread them. They are the reasons you should hire me. I’m available for long-term and short-term gigs; therefore, don’t
                    procrastinate reaching out to this brilliant freelancer before another company contacts him.
